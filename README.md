## Who am I?

- Student of Theoretical Physics at the University of Pisa.

- Interested in topological aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics, lattice simulations, dark matter and physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, the research I am most interested in at the moment concerns composite models of dark matter.

- Secondary interests: particle detection systems, other computational analysis.

## Upcoming projects that I will publish soon:

- Codes For Numerical Methods for Physicists course: contains the codes that I have written for the university course "Numerical Methods For Phycists".

- my personal website.
