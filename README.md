Student of Theoretical Physics at the University of Pisa.
Interested in topological aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics, lattice simulations, dark matter and physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, the research I am most interested in at the moment concerns composite models of dark matter.
Secondary interests: particle detection systems, other computational analysis.
